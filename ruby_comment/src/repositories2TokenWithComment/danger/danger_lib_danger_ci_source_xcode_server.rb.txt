You will need to use [Buildasaur](https://github.com/czechboy0/Buildasaur) # in order to work with Danger. This will set up your build environment for you, as the name of the bot contains all # of the environment variables that Danger needs to work. # # With Buildasaur set up, you can edit your job to add `bundle exec danger` as a post-action build script. # # ### Token Setup # # As this is self-hosted, you will need to add the `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to your build user's ENV. The alternative # is to pass in the token as a prefix to the command `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="123" bundle exec danger`.`. #
