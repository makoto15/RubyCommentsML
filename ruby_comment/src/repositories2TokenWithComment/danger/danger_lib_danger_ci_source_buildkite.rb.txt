The alternative # is to pass in the token as a prefix to the command `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="123" bundle exec danger`. # # #### GitLab # # As this is self-hosted, you will need to add the `DANGER_GITLAB_API_TOKEN` to your build user's ENV. The alternative # is to pass in the token as a prefix to the command `DANGER_GITLAB_API_TOKEN="123" bundle exec danger`. #
