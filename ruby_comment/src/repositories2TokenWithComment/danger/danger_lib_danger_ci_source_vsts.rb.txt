Then add a "Command Line" Task with the "Tool" field set to "bundle" # and the "Arguments" field set to "exec danger". # # ### Token Setup # # #### GitHub # # You need to add the `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable, to do this, go to your build definition's variables tab. # # Make sure that `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` is not set to secret since vsts does not expose secret variables while building. # # #### VSTS # # You need to add the `DANGER_VSTS_API_TOKEN` and `DANGER_VSTS_HOST` environment variable, to do this, # go to your build definition's variables tab. The `DANGER_VSTS_API_TOKEN` is your vsts personal access token. # Instructions for creating a personal access token can be found [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate). # For the `DANGER_VSTS_HOST` variable the suggested value is `$(System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri)$(System.TeamProject)` # which will automatically get your vsts domain and your project name needed for the vsts api. # # Make sure that `DANGER_VSTS_API_TOKEN` is not set to secret since vsts does not expose secret variables while building. #
