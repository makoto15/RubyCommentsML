The post has two main options: # title and body. # # ```ruby # index as: :blog do # title :my_title # Calls #my_title on each resource # body :my_body # Calls #my_body on each resource # end # ``` # # ## Post Title # # The title is the content that will be rendered within a link to the # resource. There are two main ways to set the content for the title # # First, you can pass in a method to be called on your resource. For example: # # ```ruby # index as: :blog do # title :a_method_to_call # end # ``` # # Second, you can pass a block to the tile option which will then be # used as the contents of the title. The resource being rendered # is passed in to the block. For Example: # # ```ruby # index as: :blog do # title do |post| # span post.title, class: 'title' # span post.created_at, class: 'created_at' # end # end # ``` # # ## Post Body # # The body is rendered underneath the title of each post. The same two # style of options work as the Post Title above. # # Call a method on the resource as the body: # # ```ruby # index as: :blog do # title :my_title # body :my_body # end # ``` # # Or, render a block as the body: # # ```ruby # index as: :blog do # title :my_title # body do |post| # div truncate post.title # div class: 'meta' do # span "Post in #{post.categories.join(', ')}" # end # end # end # ``` #
