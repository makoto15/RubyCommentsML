To do so, use the :grid option for the # index block. # # ```ruby # index as: :grid do |product| # link_to image_tag(product.image_path), admin_product_path(product) # end # ``` # # The block is rendered within a cell in the grid once for each resource in the # collection. The resource is passed into the block for you to use in the view. # # You can customize the number of columns that are rendered using the columns # option: # # ```ruby # index as: :grid, columns: 5 do |product| # link_to image_tag(product.image_path), admin_product_path(product) # end # ``` #
