We used to have `paper_trail.disable` inside the class, which was really # misleading because it looked like a permanent, global setting. It's so much # more obvious now that we are disabling the model for this request only. Of # course, we run the PT unit tests in a single thread, and I think this setting # will affect multiple unit tests, but in a normal application, this new API is # a huge improvement. # # TODO: If this call to `disable_model` were moved to the unit tests, this file # would be more like normal application code. It'd be pretty strange for someone # to do this in app code, especially now that it is obvious that it only affects # the current request.
