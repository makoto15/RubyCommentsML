It has zero security and should *never* be used in a # production setting. # # ## Usage # # To use the Developer strategy, all you need to do is put it in like any # other strategy: # # @example Basic Usage # # use OmniAuth::Builder do # provider :developer # end # # @example Custom Fields # # use OmniAuth::Builder do # provider :developer, # :fields => [:first_name, :last_name], # :uid_field => :last_name # end # # This will create a strategy that, when the user visits `/auth/developer` # they will be presented a form that prompts for (by default) their name # and email address. The auth hash will be populated with these fields and # the `uid` will simply be set to the provided email.
