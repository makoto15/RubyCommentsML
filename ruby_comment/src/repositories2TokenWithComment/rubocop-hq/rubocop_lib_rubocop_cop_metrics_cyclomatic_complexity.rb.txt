The cyclomatic complexity is the number of # linearly independent paths through a method. The algorithm counts # decision points and adds one. # # An if statement (or unless or ?:) increases the complexity by one. An # else branch does not, since it doesn't add a decision point. The && # operator (or keyword and) can be converted to a nested if statement, # and ||/or is shorthand for a sequence of ifs, so they also add one. # Loops can be said to have an exit condition, so they add one.
