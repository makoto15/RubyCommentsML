Mostly taken from Thor/Rails (thanks). # Normally I'm not a fan of using an indifferent access hash since Symbols # are basically memory leaks in Ruby, but since Vagrant is typically a quick # one-off binary run and it doesn't use too many hash keys where this is # used, the effect should be minimal. # # hash[:foo] #=> 'bar' # hash['foo'] #=> 'bar' #
