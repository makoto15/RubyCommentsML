In order to take advantage # of NFS synced folders, some provider-specific assistance is required. # Within the middleware sequences, some data must be put into the # environment state bag: # # * `nfs_host_ip` (string) - The IP of the host machine that the NFS # client in the machine should talk to. # * `nfs_machine_ip` (string) - The IP of the guest machine that the NFS # server should serve the folders to. # * `nfs_valid_ids` (array of strings) - A list of IDs that are "valid" # and should not be pruned. The synced folder implementation will # regularly prune NFS exports of invalid IDs. # # If any of these variables are not set, an internal exception will be # raised. #
