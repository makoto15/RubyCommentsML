Example groups that need to be run against all # algorithms should use the `with_digest_algorithms` helper which will # create a new example group for each algorithm and will run the given block # in each example group. # # For each algorithm a shared context is defined for the given algorithm that # has precomputed checksum values and paths. These contexts are included # automatically based on the rspec metadata selected with # `with_digest_algorithms`.
