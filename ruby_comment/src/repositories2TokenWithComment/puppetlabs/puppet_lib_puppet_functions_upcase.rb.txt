This is done using Ruby system locale which handles some, but not all # special international up-casing rules (for example German double-s ß is upcased to "SS", whereas upper case double-s # is downcased to ß). # * For `Array` and `Hash` the conversion to upper case is recursive and each key and value must be convertible by # this function. # * When a `Hash` is converted, some keys could result in the same key - in those cases, the # latest key-value wins. For example if keys "aBC", and "abC" where both present, after upcase there would only be one # key "ABC". # * If the value is `Numeric` it is simply returned (this is for backwards compatibility). # * An error is raised for all other data types. # # Please note: This function relies directly on Ruby's String implementation and as such may not be entirely UTF8 compatible. # To ensure best compatibility please use this function with Ruby 2.4.0 or greater - https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10085. # # @example Converting a String to upper case # ```puppet # 'hello'.upcase() # upcase('hello') # ``` # Would both result in "HELLO" # # @example Converting an Array to upper case # ```puppet # ['a', 'b'].upcase() # upcase(['a', 'b']) # ``` # Would both result in ['A', 'B'] # # @example Converting a Hash to upper case # ```puppet # {'a' => 'hello', 'b' => 'goodbye'}.upcase() # ``` # Would result in `{'A' => 'HELLO', 'B' => 'GOODBYE'}` # # @example Converting a recursive structure # ```puppet # ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d']], {'x' => 'y'}].upcase # ``` # Would result in `['A', 'B', ['C', ['D']], {'X' => 'Y'}]` #
