This is # three separate fields: # # system_u is the user context # object_r is the role context # root_t is the type context # # All three of these fields are returned in a single string by the # output of the stat command, but set individually with the chcon # command. This allows the user to specify a subset of the three # values while leaving the others alone. # # See https://www.nsa.gov/selinux/ for complete docs on SELinux.
