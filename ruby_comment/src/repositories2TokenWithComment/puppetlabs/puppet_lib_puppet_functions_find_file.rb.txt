(For example, the reference `mysql/mysqltuner.pl` will search for the # file `<MODULES DIRECTORY>/mysql/files/mysqltuner.pl`.) # # This function can also accept: # # * An absolute String path, which checks for the existence of a file from anywhere on disk. # * Multiple String arguments, which returns the path of the **first** file # found, skipping nonexistent files. # * An array of string paths, which returns the path of the **first** file # found from the given paths in the array, skipping nonexistent files. # # The function returns `undef` if none of the given paths were found. # # @since 4.8.0 #
