It is highly recommended that every Agent verify this token whenever # #receive_web_request is called. For example, one of your Agent's options could be :secret and you could compare this # value to params[:secret] whenever #receive_web_request is called on your Agent, rejecting invalid requests. # # Your Agent's #receive_web_request method should return an Array of json_or_string_response, status_code, # optional mime type, and optional hash of custom response headers. For example: # [{status: "success"}, 200] # or # ["not found", 404, 'text/plain'] # or # ["<status>success</status>", 200, 'text/xml', {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin" => "*"}]
